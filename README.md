# KotlinAndMe
In this project I am going  to explore Kotlin and have some fun with it :relieved: :wink:

After Google officially added support for Kotlin programming language, many developers wanted to give it a try and see how powerful it is! :sunglasses:                                  

So here I exploring it and getting my hands dirty with Kotlin :metal:

I will keep updating this project, adding useful resources as and when I learn more about Kotlin, hoping it be useful to  someone who is starting with Kotlin. 

Stay Tuned! :raised_hands:
